# How do biological systems adapt to critical events?

- - -

Life is dangerous. \
You can die at any time. \
Or at least be injured. \
Or the very least, be stressed.\
\
Yet, we (and other biological systems) manage to survive daily traumatic events for a long period of time. How is that? What mechanisms help us to cope with those traumas?\
\
I am looking for answers!\
\
Therefore, I study the biophysical processes supporting biological systems that undergo catastrophic events, from starvation to organ injuries.\
\
As living systems are complex, I use a multi-disciplinary approach to paint a multifaceted portrait of the biological and physical processes across scales. Thus, I combine engineering, physics, biology, mathematics, and computer science to investigate the adaptation mechanisms to cellular stress and tissue injury.
